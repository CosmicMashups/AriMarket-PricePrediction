This chapter covers the results from the analysis and model evaluations, accompanied by a detailed discussion of the findings. Various graphs have been generated to illustrate key aspects of the data, including performance metrics and model diagnostics. These visualizations provide insights into the accuracy of the ARIMA model, the distribution of residuals, and the overall effectiveness of the forecasting process. The graphs highlight critical evaluation metrics such as the Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and the autocorrelation of residuals, offering a comprehensive view of the model's predictive power and areas for improvement. Through these graphs, the underlying patterns and performance characteristics of the ARIMA model are examined and interpreted.
 
4.2.   Model Training Performance
Figure 6. Training Performance Comparison using Mean Absolute Error
 
Figure 6 provides a detailed and insightful comparison of the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) values across a range of commodities, offering a clearer understanding of the predictive performance of the model. The graph reveals that 11 specific commodities have MAE values below 10, highlighting relatively strong prediction accuracy for these items. These commodities, including "Well-Milled Rice", "Pork Ham", and "Bangus", demonstrate notably lower error margins, indicating that the model has successfully predicted their values with minimal deviation. This consistent accuracy across these items suggests that the model is capable of identifying and capturing stable and predictable patterns within the data. The lower MAE values reflect a well-calibrated model that works effectively for commodities that exhibit steady price trends or less volatility.
In contrast, the remaining commodities exhibit MAE values above 10, signaling lower prediction accuracy and suggesting that the model faces greater challenges with these items. Among these, three commodity groups—Vegetables, Spices, and Fruits—stand out, with certain specific commodities exceeding an MAE of 50. These commodities have particularly high error margins, indicating that the model struggles to provide accurate predictions for these items, likely due to factors such as significant price fluctuations, supply-demand imbalances, or irregular trends that are difficult to predict. The substantial deviation between predicted and actual values for these commodities suggests that their price dynamics are more volatile, making them more complex for the model to forecast reliably. Therefore, while the model performs well for many commodities, it faces notable challenges in forecasting prices for those with greater volatility and unpredictable patterns.






Figure 7. Training Performance Comparison using Mean Absolute Error
 
As shown in Figure 7, 11 specific commodities have MAE values below 10, suggesting that the model performs relatively well in predicting these items. Notably, four of these commodities—particularly those from the Rice category—are significantly closer to a value of 0. These results indicate that the model achieves very low error margins for these specific rice types, demonstrating a high level of predictive accuracy for these commodities. The low MAE values for these rice varieties reflect stable and predictable data patterns, which the model can capture effectively.
In contrast, the remaining commodities exhibit MAE values above 10, signifying less accurate predictions for these items. Among these, three commodity groups stand out, each with specific commodities exceeding an MAE of 50. These groups, including Vegetables, Spices, and Fruits, contain commodities with particularly high error margins, indicating that the model struggles to predict prices accurately for these items. The high MAE values suggest that these commodities may experience significant price volatility or irregular trends, which make them more challenging for the model to forecast reliably.
4.3.   Rice Group Model Evaluation
Figure 8. Mean Absolute Error for Each Commodity in Rice Group
 
In Figure 8, the bar graph shows the model performance for the commodities in the Rice group demonstrating a notably high level of accuracy, as all the items in this category exhibit Mean Absolute Error (MAE) values below 2. This is a clear indication that the model is capable of producing highly reliable and precise predictions for rice-related commodities. Specifically, "Well-Milled Rice" stands out with the lowest MAE value across both price ranges, particularly for high prices, where it achieves an impressively low MAE of 0.616. This low value suggests that the model performs exceptionally well in predicting the prices for this commodity, with minimal deviation between the predicted and actual values. The model's ability to predict high prices for "Well-Milled Rice" with such a small error margin is indicative of strong predictive accuracy and consistency.
Furthermore, the other rice commodities, including "Regular-Milled Rice", "Premium Rice", and "Special Rice", also show strong model performance. These commodities all feature MAE values consistently below 2, both for high and low-price predictions, further confirming the model’s effectiveness in forecasting the price trends for rice items. "Regular-Milled Rice" has an MAE of 1.598 for high prices and 1.913 for low prices, while "Premium Rice" achieves MAE values of 0.784 and 1.243 for high and low prices, respectively. "Special Rice" has an MAE of 1.906 for high prices and 1.990 for low prices, which, although slightly higher, still reflects a solid performance.
4.4.   Meat Group Model Evaluation
Figure 9. Mean Absolute Error for Each Commodity in Meat Group
 
The bar graph in Figure 9 presents the model performance for the commodities in the Meat group showing generally strong predictive accuracy, with most items exhibiting Mean Absolute Error (MAE) values below 10. This suggests that the model is able to provide relatively accurate predictions for the prices of most meat commodities. Notably, "Pork Ham" stands out as the commodity with the lowest MAE value, particularly for high prices, where it achieves an impressive MAE of 3.072. This low value reflects the model's excellent performance in predicting the prices for this item, showing minimal error for both high and low-price forecasts. Similarly, other commodities such as "Pork Belly" and "Beef Rump" demonstrate solid performance, with MAE values of 3.159 and 6.653 for high prices, respectively, further reinforcing the model’s effectiveness in predicting prices for these meat items.
However, one specific commodity, "Beef Brisket," has a significantly higher MAE value, particularly for high prices, where it reaches 14.679. This represents a noticeable challenge for the model, indicating that it struggles to accurately predict the price of "Beef Brisket," especially when prices are high. This higher MAE suggests that the model may be encountering difficulty in capturing the price fluctuations or underlying trends for "Beef Brisket," possibly due to factors such as price volatility or irregular market conditions specific to this commodity. Despite this, the MAE value for low prices of "Beef Brisket" (2.027) is relatively low, indicating that the model performs better when predicting lower price levels for this item.
4.5.   Fish Group Model Evaluation
Figure 10. Mean Absolute Error for Each Commodity in Fish Group
 
The model performance for the commodities in the Fish group reflects a mix of strong and weaker results, demonstrating the varying levels of accuracy in predicting prices for different fish items. Some commodities, such as "Bangus" and "Tilapia", have demonstrated exceptional performance, with both exhibiting Mean Absolute Error (MAE) values well below 10. Specifically, "Bangus" has an MAE of 7.097 for high prices and 6.870 for low prices, while "Tilapia" has an MAE of 8.214 for high prices and 6.826 for low prices. These low values indicate that the models for these two fish types are performing excellently, capturing the price trends with high accuracy and minimal deviation. The ability of the model to predict both high and low prices for "Bangus" and "Tilapia" with such precision suggests that these commodities follow relatively stable price patterns that the model can easily capture.
In addition to these top performers, "Alumahan" shows moderately strong performance, though with slightly higher MAE values compared to "Bangus" and "Tilapia." Specifically, "Alumahan" has an MAE of 13.345 for high prices and 18.412 for low prices. While these values are somewhat higher, they still reflect a reasonably good performance overall. An MAE value below 20 indicates that the model is still able to predict prices for "Alumahan" with a reasonable degree of accuracy, despite the commodity's price fluctuations or potential market volatility. The higher MAE values could be attributed to the variability in the prices of "Alumahan," which might be influenced by factors such as seasonal availability, regional price disparities, or other unpredictable market forces.
However, "Galunggong" stands out as an outlier in this group, exhibiting significantly higher MAE values than the other fish commodities. Specifically, the MAE for "Galunggong" reaches 36.916 for high prices and 21.244 for low prices. These values are considerably higher than the other commodities, indicating that the model struggles to predict "Galunggong" prices accurately. The large discrepancies between predicted and actual prices for "Galunggong" suggest that the model encounters difficulties in capturing the complex pricing patterns associated with this commodity. There could be several reasons for this, including irregular price fluctuations, supply chain disruptions, or even seasonal demand shifts that the model fails to account for effectively. Such challenges may reflect a need for further refinement of the model, including the incorporation of additional factors or more advanced techniques to better handle the price volatility of "Galunggong".
4.6.   Fruits Group Model Evaluation
Figure 11. Mean Absolute Error for Each Commodity in Fruits Group
 
The model performance for the commodities in the Fruits group demonstrates a mix of strong and weaker results, reflecting varying levels of accuracy in predicting prices. Most of the commodities in this group have Mean Absolute Error (MAE) values that barely reach 10, indicating that the models are performing well in capturing price trends for these items. "Banana (Lakatan)" stands out with the lowest MAE values of all the commodities in this group, with an MAE of 5.514 for high prices and 3.543 for low prices. These low values suggest that the model performs excellently for "Banana (Lakatan)," with a high degree of accuracy in predicting both high and low prices. The model's ability to consistently predict the prices of "Banana (Lakatan)" with minimal deviation indicates that this commodity's price is relatively stable and predictable, making it an ideal fit for the model.
Other commodities in the Fruits group, such as "Calamansi" and "Papaya", have slightly higher MAE values. "Calamansi" has an MAE of 10.540 for high prices and 14.499 for low prices, while "Papaya" has an MAE of 10.665 for high prices and 7.149 for low prices. These values suggest that the model still performs reasonably well for these commodities, though with slightly more variability than for "Banana (Lakatan)." Despite these higher error margins, the model still captures the price trends of "Calamansi" and "Papaya" with relatively good accuracy, as their MAE values are still below 15, which indicates decent performance overall.
However, "Mango" stands out as a notable exception in the Fruits group due to its significantly higher MAE values. The model's performance for "Mango" shows a substantial discrepancy between the predicted and actual prices, with an MAE of 67.152 for high prices and 46.159 for low prices. These high values indicate that the model struggles to predict "Mango" prices accurately, and there are substantial errors in the predicted values. This could be due to a variety of factors, such as large fluctuations in "Mango" prices that the model is unable to capture effectively. Factors such as seasonal price changes, regional price disparities, or unpredictable market dynamics may contribute to the high MAE values for "Mango." This suggests that the model may need further refinement, including the incorporation of additional variables or more sophisticated techniques to better account for the price volatility of "Mango".
4.7.   Vegetables Group Model Evaluation
Figure 12. Mean Absolute Error for Each Commodity in Vegetables Group
 
The model performance for the commodities in the Vegetables group shows a range of MAE values, indicating varying degrees of accuracy across the different items. All commodities in this group have an average MAE value between 15 and 55, suggesting a moderate performance for the models overall. Among these, "Potato" stands out with the lowest MAE values, indicating the best performance within this group. Specifically, the MAE for high prices is 15.573, and for low prices, it is 19.365. These values suggest that the model performs fairly well in predicting the price trends for "Potato," with relatively low errors in both high and low-price predictions. While this performance is good, it is still a sign that there may be some fluctuations in the market for this commodity, causing moderate deviations in the predictions.
Other commodities in this group, such as "Cabbage," "Carrots," and "Eggplant," exhibit higher MAE values, ranging from the low 20s to the high 30s. "Cabbage" has an MAE of 21.305 for high prices and 20.013 for low prices, while "Carrots" shows an MAE of 34.317 for high prices and 30.922 for low prices, and "Eggplant" has an MAE of 39.818 for high prices and 32.773 for low prices. These results indicate that the model still performs moderately well for these commodities, but there are more substantial deviations in its predictions compared to "Potato." The higher error margins suggest that market conditions for these vegetables might be more volatile, making it harder for the model to predict their price movements with the same level of accuracy.
The commodity with the highest MAE values in this group is "Tomato," which shows a particularly large discrepancy between predicted and actual prices. The model for "Tomato" has an MAE of 55.680 for high prices and 39.219 for low prices. This significant deviation points to a relatively poor performance in predicting tomato prices, especially for high prices, where the model's predictions seem to struggle the most. The high MAE for "Tomato" could be a result of significant price fluctuations or external factors such as supply chain disruptions, seasonal changes, or demand surges that the model has difficulty accounting for. Overall, while the models for most vegetables perform moderately well, "Tomato" stands out as a commodity with substantial prediction errors, indicating that additional factors may need to be considered for more accurate forecasting.
4.8.   Spices Group Model Evaluation
Figure 13. Mean Absolute Error for Each Commodity in Spices Group
 
The model performance for the commodities in the Spices group presents a mixed outcome. "Red Onion" shows the lowest MAE values in this group, with a value of 4.771 for high prices and 5.219 for low prices. These relatively low MAE values indicate that the model is performing moderately well for "Red Onion," making accurate predictions with minimal deviation from the actual prices. The model captures the price trends for "Red Onion" with reasonable accuracy, suggesting that the pricing dynamics for this commodity are relatively stable and predictable, allowing the model to provide a good forecast.
On the other hand, "Garlic" demonstrates significantly higher MAE values, with an MAE of 63.387 for high prices and 34.092 for low prices. These values are the highest MAE values out of all the commodities, indicating poor model performance. The large discrepancy between predicted and actual prices for "Garlic" suggests that the model struggles to accurately forecast price trends for this particular commodity. The high volatility in the price of "Garlic" could be contributing to the higher error margins, making it more challenging for the model to generate precise predictions. Consequently, the performance of the "Garlic" model is notably weaker compared to "Red Onion", reflecting challenges in predicting the price movements for this spice.
